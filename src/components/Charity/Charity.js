            I am a member of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.givingwhatwecan.org'>Giving What We Can</a> whose
            members pledge to give at least 10% of their income to charities they
            believe are most effective at helping people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I pledged to donate more than 10% because I felt able to do so, and
            wanted to make altruism a bigger part of my life.
