            I am a member of <a href='https://www.givingwhatwecan.org'>Giving What We Can</a> which
            means I pledge to give away at least 10% of my income to charities that
            I think will benefit the world the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            I pledged to donate more than 10% because I felt able to do so, and
            wanted to make altruism a bigger part of my life.

            I encourage you to <a href='https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/become-member'>become a member too</a>, there
